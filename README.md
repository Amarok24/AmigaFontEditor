# AmigaFontEditor
AmigaFontEditor is a very basic font editor intended for Amiga's assembler programmers.

The goal of AmigaFontEditor is to let you draw for each grid a character ranging from ascii 32 up to 128 and get merge all of them in a single binary file ready to be included in your Amiga assembler program with the instruction `incbin'.

You can also inspect the binary content using the show binary and show hex buttons and restore a previously saved binary file with the `Import From Raw File' button.

AmigaFontEditor has not dependencies, entirely written in pure javascript and can run offline.
You can try it live now at [http://amigafonteditor.ozzyboshi.com]
